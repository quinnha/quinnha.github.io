This is a personal website that highlights who I am, my experiences, and my skills. As React is getting more popular, I thought it would be a good idea to dip my toes into it, and revamp my website! 

## To-do
- Fix Contact button to route to bottom of home page
- Reorganize files (it's a mess)
- Fix refresh 404 error on astronaut and missions pages
